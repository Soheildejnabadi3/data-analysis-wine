## Data Analysis with Wine data

In this data science project, I analyzed wine quality prediction using machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. I evaluated each model's performance across multiple metrics such as accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate, precision, and F-score.

The analysis revealed that SVM achieved the highest accuracy at 74.73%, closely followed by Logistic Regression at 73.61% and Random Forest at 73.48%. While the Decision Tree model had the lowest accuracy, it showed competitive performance in other metrics. 

This project demonstrated my skills in implementing and comparing multiple machine learning algorithms, as well as interpreting complex model performance data in the context of wine quality prediction.
